              Thank you for submitting your request for accommodations. We require supporting documentation to fulfill<br>
              your request.<br>
              Documentation must be from an appropriate, qualified professional who has seen you within the past 18<br>
              months and must contain the following information:<br>
              1. You are a person with a disability.<br>
              2. The diagnosis (what is the disability?)<br>
              3. Information about the necessary classroom accommodations you will need to<br>
              successfully complete the semester. There must be a nexus between the disability and<br>
              the accommodations requested.<br>
              4. Name and credentials (license #, etc.) of the diagnostic clinician.<br>
              Documentation may be emailed to me, but it must be on official letterhead. If your doctorâ€™s office is<br>
              unwilling to email me (this is the most likely scenario), they may mail the document to you. Then, scan<br>
              and email it to me.<br>
              Once the information is submitted, we will schedule a time to meet to discuss the details (in person or via<br>
              video conference). After our meeting, I will email your professors your specific ADA academic<br>
              accommodations letter. Accommodations MUST BE RENEWED EACH SEMESTER.<br>
              Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns. I look forward to hearing from you.<br>
              Sincerely,<b>`
