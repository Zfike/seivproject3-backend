# Oklahoma Christian Accommodations

## Project Overview
The Oklahoma Christian Accommodations project is a combination of backend and frontend services to provide a flawless user experiences for both students and administrators. The goal of the project was to provide one, students with the ability to view and request accommodations specific to their needs, and two, to provide administrators with the ability to view the requests and accept, deny, and update them based on the student's needs. The goal of the project was to not only make the functionality great but to also make it simple and efficient. 

## Backend Services
The backend services for this project assist in storing data from the project for efficient data creation, retrieval, modification, and deletion.

## Models
Below are a couple of examples to help explain the foundation of the backend for the project.

### -Users
The User Model is the foundation of our project storing all of the user information. Our project leverages Google Authentication allowing users to securely log in with their Google credentials. This ensures a seamless and trustworthy authentication process, contributing to a user-friendly experience.

### -Sessions
To maintain a secure and persistent user experience we have implemented the Session Model. This model handles the creation and management of user sessions after successful authentication. Sessions are used for keeping users logged in and to provide a seamless experience moving between different parts of the website.

### -Conclusion
We encourage you to explore the backend codebase to gain a deeper understanding of how these models interact and contribute to the functioning of our project.
